Architecture Questions

1. How would you optimize API calls in this application for performance?

To optimize API calls, I would implement debouncing or throttling for user-triggered requests, such as search queries, to minimize unnecessary API calls. Additionally, I would batch multiple requests when possible and leverage pagination for large datasets. Using caching mechanisms like client-side caching (localStorage, IndexedDB) and server-side caching (Redis) would reduce redundant network requests. I would also prefer WebSockets or GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates instead of frequent polling.

2. Describe your approach to handling shared logic between components.

For shared logic, I would use composables (Vue 3) or mixins (Vue 2) to extract reusable functions and state management logic. If the logic involves global state, I would use a store like Pinia or Vuex. Utility functions would be placed in separate modules to ensure modularity and reusability. Additionally, for UI-related logic, shared components or higher-order components (HOCs) can be used to encapsulate behaviors that multiple components need.

3. How would you implement client-side data caching for this dashboard?

I would implement client-side caching using a combination of browser storage solutions like localStorage, sessionStorage, or IndexedDB. For API calls, I would use libraries such as Vue Query or Apollo Client, which provide built-in caching and automatic data fetching optimizations. Additionally, I would set cache expiration times and implement a stale-while-revalidate strategy to refresh outdated data in the background while displaying cached content.

4. What strategy would you use to scale this application if it needed to support hundreds of different user permission types?

To handle extensive user permissions, I would implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) with a centralized permission management system. I would store user roles and permissions in a database and use middleware or API gateways to enforce access control at the backend. On the frontend, I would use Vue directives or route guards to dynamically control UI visibility based on user permissions, ensuring a scalable and maintainable approach.

5. Explain your testing strategy and how you decided what to test.

I would adopt a multi-layered testing approach, including unit tests for individual functions and components, integration tests for interactions between components, and end-to-end (E2E) tests for user workflows. Unit tests would focus on critical functions like API calls and state management, while integration tests would validate form interactions and API data handling. I would use Jest for unit and integration testing and Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing to ensure full coverage and reliability.

6. How would you handle offline capabilities in this application?

For offline capabilities, I would implement service workers with Workbox to cache essential assets and API responses. IndexedDB would be used to store data locally, allowing the app to function without an internet connection. I would also implement background sync to queue API requests and send them when connectivity is restored. A clear UI indicator would inform users of their offline status and pending actions to ensure a seamless user experience.
